### Heart Disease Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

##### 📌 Project Overview



This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

It is built with Python and Jupyter Notebook and leverages medical dataset features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.



##### 🚀 Features



Data preprocessing and visualization



Training an ANN model for classification



Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)



Easy-to-use and extend for further experiments

##### ▶️ Usage



Clone this repository:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git

cd heart-disease-prediction





Open the Jupyter Notebook:



jupyter notebook ANN.ipynb





Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.



##### 📊 Dataset



The model is trained on a Heart Disease dataset (such as the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset

).

You can replace it with any similar dataset for experiments.



##### 📈 Results



The ANN model achieves 77% accuracy on the test set.



Performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are included in the notebook.
